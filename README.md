This project is a three minute animation short film abut a scientist performing an experiment that goes awry. The video begins with the scientist driving his expensive sports car to show he is a successful researcher. Once at his building, He has to go trough many doors and elevators to get to his specialized laboratory. He must also go through very rigorous security measures because his work is potentially dangerous. Once in his lab, the scientists sits in a high tech control station were he prepares the particle collier right in from of him. Once everything looks good and the experiment is ready, the count down begins and the researcher sits back drinking a cold one to relax. A thunder storm approaches his lab and just as the experiment is about to conclude a lighting bolt strikes his lab. The accelerated particle in the collider is followed by the lightning then this two combined stricking the scientist. This accident creates a gap on the desk and floor, and the scientist is no where to be seen. Finally, at the end the protagonist is transported into another world which looks like a beautiful fantasy world.   

This short was created with the use of different techniques. The modeling was mostly done by sculpting polygon and nurb objects. The cell shading effect was created using the toon shader available in Maya. Even though the look seems simple it was actually difficult to get right because it took a lot of tweaking with the lightning and the different colors and shades. For the special effects water caustics, lightning, and glow were used. The animation was not only done with key framing, but also with simple MEL expressions. The motion capture data was not used because it was taken mostly for experience but also because I realized that the short I was planning to do, which was a different story, would have been about five minutes long which is too long based on the requirements. Finally, the rendered images were compiled using Quicktime and edited using Open Shot. Overall this project was challenging and very rewarding.
